# ObsidianTheologicalStudies
A demo vault for theological studies with Obsidian 
#ObsidianOctober/2022

---

Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome ! 

I am [@Limezy](https://github.com/Limezy) and this is my Obsidian October 2022 submission, under the "demo vault" category, in the name of [AnthropologieBiblique](https://github.com/AnthropologieBiblique), a group of French catholics whose aim is to provide digital tools or ressources to help exegesis and theological work, in particular with the Obsidian software.

Unsurprisingly, this vault will be a demo of why we believe Obsidian to be the best tool currently available for exegesis, theological and philosophical studies.

Hopefully, this vault will help students in these fields (seminarists, theologians etc...) to : 
- Understand how powerful and helpful this software can be
- Get started using a few (opinionated) setups and tools we have built around it
- Benefit and contribute to the work [AnthropologieBiblique](https://github.com/AnthropologieBiblique) has been starting ("obsidianization" of a lot of available theological and biblical ressources online)

The idea is very simple : we have prepared a small tour, starting from that note. At each step, it will stay on the right for you to read. You'll just have to click a button everytime you see one, and that will walk you through different demo scenes. Feel free to play with them at each step, you won't break anything.

```button
