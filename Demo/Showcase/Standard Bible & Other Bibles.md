### Standard & other Bibles

As we have seen, this vault features a lot of Bibles. All share the same file and notes structure. One of them is called the "reference Bible". The idea is that this is your primary bible, the one that you can link by default. The books and chapters will be accessible to link without any prefix. 

You can also link to all the other bibles, just by appending their dedicated prefix on the left.

| **Prefix** | **Bible**              |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| BHS    | Hebrew             |
| LXX    | Septante (Greek)   |
| PST    | Peshitta (Aramean) |
| VG     | Vulgata (Latin)                   |

Here is an example of link to the Vulgata : [[VG Jn 1#14]]
Of course, I can format that link as if it were a normal reference, using an alias : [[VG Jn 1#14|Jn 1, 14]]

Here is that same reference, transcluded from the Peshitta :

![[PST Jn 1#14]]
