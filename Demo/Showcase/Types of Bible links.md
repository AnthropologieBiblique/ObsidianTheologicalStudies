### Types of biblical links

| **Type of link**      | **Syntax**                         | **Example**    | **Remark** | 
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Link to a book        | `[[Book]]`                         | [[Jn]]         | Standard wikilink         |
| Link to a chapter     | `[[Chapter]]`                      | [[Jn 1]]       | Standard wikilink         |
| Link to a verse       | `[[Chapter#Verse]]`                | [[Jn 1#14]]    | Standard wikilink         |
| Link to a verse range | `[[Chapter#VerseA#VerseB]]` | [[Jn 1#14#20]] |  Plugin powered*         |

These links to a verse range, widely used in the Bible study, are made possible using a dedicated plugin, called "Link heading range". That plugin also makes possible the idomatic *Chapter, VerseA-VerseB* formatting of biblical references.

> ⚠️ The link to a verse range is not yet compatible with the transclusion `![[...]]` syntax

Don't hesitate to hover over the example links, to see how things are going.
Being able to read any referenced passage of the Bible, in any language, in a fraction of a second is a life-changer.
