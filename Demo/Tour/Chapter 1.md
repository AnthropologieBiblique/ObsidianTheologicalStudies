### Chapter 1 : Obsidian to read the Bible or theological works

Here, you are using Obsidian to read the Bible. As you can see, all bibles are in a folder called "Bible". You can navigate through them by using the Bible > Book > Chapter flow (see the different tabs).

Each chapter is one unique note. Each verse is a level 6 heading in that note. This layout of the Bible has become quite standard among Obsidian users.

You may have noticed that there is much more than one Bible. The clever tag system of Obsidian will help us quickly navigate between the different Bible versions and translations. Let's move to the next scene !

```button
name Let's move on to the next scene ðŸ‘‰
type command
action Workspaces Plus: Load: Chapter 1.1
```

By clicking on the tag tree #Bible/Jn/1 on the top of a chapter, you'll see on the search bar on the left all the other versions and translations of that same biblical chapter. A few click after you'll be within a perfectly fitted reading space to compare versions and translations.

Hopefully one day a contributor will create a plugin which will allow synchronizing the scroll between these different views !

Let's now have a look at one of the major theological works that was ever done by humanity : the Summa Theologia by Saint Thomas Acquinas. This demo vault includes it both in French and in Latin.

```button
name Next scene please ! ðŸ‘‰
type command
action Workspaces Plus: Load: Chapter 1.2
```

As you can see, the concept is exactly the same.
The whole Summa is in the vault, here both in French and in Latin.
Every articulus has its own note, and French and Latin share the same tag tree, to allow for quick movements between both.

When overing over a Bible link, you'll be able to read the linked Bible extract - very convenient (I let you imagine how long it is to get access to these references using real books... )
