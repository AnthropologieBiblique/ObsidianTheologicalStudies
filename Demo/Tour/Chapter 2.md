#### Bible quote buttons

Sometimes you remember where the verse you want to quote is, but not exactly. Is that on verse 12 or verse 14 ? For that, we have built two bible quote buttons on the ribbon on the left.

One aims at going the fastest possible, it will use the standard bible by default (for this demo vault, it's the French AELF, but it can be easily changed) and only output a standard quote. You'll be able to read the first words of a chapter's verses before deciding which one you want to quote. To quote only one verse, click twice on the same verse. To quote a range, chose one verse then the other.

```button
name ðŸ‘ˆ Click to try it by yourself
type command
action Workspaces Plus: Load: Chapter 2.3
```

The second one is slower but goes more into details. You'll be able to chose the Bible you want to quote

```button
name ðŸ‘ˆ Click to try it by yourself
type command
action Workspaces Plus: Load: Chapter 2.4
```

That was fun, but it can be done with a lot of other softwares, right ?
