This will end this tour, which is already more than long enough... There could have been 10 more chapters about how I use Obsidian until the very end of an academic work, including citations, pandoc export to LaTeX etc etc... 

Obsidian is really a game changer, and the fact that you can throw at it litterally dozens of thousands of markdown notes from Bible translations, major theological works etc... clearly makes it, in our humble opininon, the best available Bible tool in the market.

Thanks for your interest and for the time you spent with us.
