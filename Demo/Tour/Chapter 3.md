### Chapter 3 : backlinks & commentaries

#### Bible backlinks

As you may know, one of Obsidian's  main powers is its ability to search or list backlinks to a given note. Here, the bible chapter Jn 1 is shown and active on the left. You can see a list of backlinks on the right top panel. I have filtered these with the keyword "note". 

Among other things, you'll see there a reference to some demo notes I've written and that is shown on the bottom left, with a link to that chapter.

However, these backlinks are backlinks to the page (in our case, the biblical chapter). This is powerful but comes in with two main problems.

1. The first one is that you'll very quickly be overwhelmed by references. Now that we have removed "note" from the top field, you'll see that that simple bible chapter has already 216 references to it ! That's impossible to manage, and this demo vault is only a fraction of our real working vault... 
2. Most of exegis work will require much more detailed insights, verse by verse ! How can we achieve that ? That's the purpose of our "commentary bible"

#### Commented bible

The commented bible is a key part of my that demo.
It has been made possible thanks to the Obsidian Query Control plugin.

The idea is pretty simple : it's a full bible, sharing the same structure and tag tree as the others. However, its content is slightly different. It's basically a transclusion of each verses of the reference bible (here in French, but this can be very easily changed) followed by a special query box that will surface back every single link to that given verse from your vault. 

> 👈 Don't hesitate to expand the results, play a little bit with buttons and scroll to understand how this works. This is just a demo vault so you won't have a lot of references surfacing. In my personal vault, I will have dozens of them below each verse !

Because it is scanning your entire vault, the loading time can be of a few seconds : but it's totally worth it ! Just like for any other queries from the interface, you can modify the query, filter it using different criteria etc etc... 

You can use that bible side by side with your current work... 
Side by side with other translations of the bible... 

Let's now have a look at other things that can help with theological studies.
